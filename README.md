# Period Professionals

## Introduction 

Period Professionals is the result of my first Individual Project at the Code Institute's Full Stack Bootcamp. The project gives the user a basic understanding of menstrual equity in the workplace, through the lens of diversity and inclusion as outlined in the project's brief. Period Professionals is a glimpse into everything I have learnt over the first five weeks of the Bootcamp using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, combined with my love for bold branding and bold ideas.

## UX Design

Site Ownerâ€™s Goal:
The site owner aims to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate webpage that introduces diversity and inclusion concepts and offers basic guidance on how to implement these practices. The focus is on clear communication through effective use of HTML and CSS, utilising Bootstrap for layout and design.
